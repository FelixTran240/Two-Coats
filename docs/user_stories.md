# User Stories and Exceptions

User stories for our CSC365 project focused on providing a place to learn about stock market trading in a safe, educational environment.

## User Stories
1. As a new user, I want to be able to create a personalized user so that I can save my lessons/ trades.
   
2. As a first-time investor, I want to learn about stock trends risk-free so that I don't lose money. 

3. As a user, I want to create a personal watchlist of stocks so that I can easily track my favorite assets over time.

4. As a user, I want to simulate a portfolio based on historical data so that I can practice trading strategies without financial risk.

5. As a student, I want to access educational examples or sample queries so that I can learn how to use the API more effectively.

6. As a returning user, I want to have a watchlist and notes so that I can revisit my learning progress across sessions.

7. As a teacher, I want to set up a portfolio with investments of my suggestion to show them the results of my strategies without showing them my real money. I wouldn't want to be putting my personal money into a new portfolio (that mirrors what I already do) every time a new quarter comes around either.

8. As a parent, I want my children to learn about investing and develop an investment strategy that suits their risk tolerance the best.

9. As a fund manager of a recently established mutual fund, I want to be able to monitor how potential/new hires will handle our customers' money. By seeing if their investment strategies align with our customers' goals, this will give me a better sense of whether they would be a good hire or not. If I see potential, I can also give my personal insight on what can be improved.

10. As a learning investor, I want to be able to create an fake-investing portfolio so I can get a feel for what it's like to have a real investment portfolio

11. As a frequent user, I want to be able to access my portfolio in a secure way so I can easily see the progress of my fake-investment portfoloio

12. As a learning investor, I want this service to follow all the same protocols that a normal investing service would (PDT rule, market open & close times) so that I have a more seamless tranistion to a real investment portfolio
