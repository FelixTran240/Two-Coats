## Parameters of project
We want to build a backend API that collects, stores, and serves historical and real-time market data for major tech stocks, including ETFs & index funds that consist of them. Our system will fetch data from a public financial API and persist it in a relational database to allow for querying and analysis over time. Users can retrieve stock price history, track trends, and add watchlists or personal notes for specific stocks. This API will include read and write operations, such as saving user watchlists and custom insights. The data will serve as the authoritative record for market trend tracking and user-specific interactions. The project will be public and open-source, intended for developers, analysts, or students interested.
